Grid scale storage (GSS) offers valuable benefits for economic and reliable operation of the grid. This project aims to develop a hybrid energy management system (EMS) to coordinate and optimize various services of a GSS to the grid and/or utilities. The dynamic life estimation (degradation) analysis for GSS based on experimental data will also be investigated. All the developed GSS scheduling algorithm will be verified by the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test using OPAL-RT and practical GSS.
