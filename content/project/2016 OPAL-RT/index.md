The objective of this project to set up a real-time co-simulation platform for analyzing electric power grid operation, taking into account integrated communication systems. A co-simulation platform can be set up using OPNET and OPAL-RT as communication and power system simulators, respectively. The platform can be used to analyze performance of the smart grid operation in real-time.
