abstract = "With the introduction of the smart grid, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has become an important element in the modern power system. The successful implementation of AMI is dependent on its communication scheme that provides reliable two-way communications. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of possible AMI communication network infrastructures based on real-world smart grid projects, and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. The most promising AMI communication scheme is then recommended, which is a hybrid version of WiMAX and fiber optic. The recommended solution is simulated in OPNET using the case study of a small-scale AMI network. Network performance is then evaluated based on smart metering system requirements specified in IEEE Std 2030-2011."
